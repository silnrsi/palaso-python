Palaso-Python
-------------
This contains python scripts, modules and packages created by SIL at the Payap 
Linguistic Institute Computing Unit. These are used by and made available for 
future use by Payap language software programs developed at the Computing Unit 
such as ptxplus.

This includes modules for:
    o Support or Unicode in CSV file (palaso.unicsv)
    o Import, export & manipulation of collation data (palaso.collation)
    o Data generation from regexps (palaso.reggen)
    o A Python interface to SIL's TECkit encoding conversion library.


This is a standard python distutils project and also a debian package too.
